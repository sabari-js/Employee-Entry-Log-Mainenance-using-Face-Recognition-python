# Employee-Entry-Log-Mainenance-using-Face-Recognition-python
It is a automated attendance system. In this project to take the attendance using face recognition. Haarcasecade  classifier is used to detect the faces and local binary pattern histogram is used to face recognition. It capture  the userâ€™s image and convert it to grayscale and  find the values using LPBH Algorithm. Trained model is used  to predict faces and save their attendance automatically. It is developed in python.
